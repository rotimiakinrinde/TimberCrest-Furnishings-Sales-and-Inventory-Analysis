# TimberCrest-Furnishings-Sales-and-Inventory-Analysis

### Overview

TimberCrest Furnishings operates across various U.S. cities, providing essential office supplies, furnishings, maintenance equipment, and more. The analysis aims to help the company ensure productivity and efficiency in public and private spaces by optimizing its sales performance, product inventory, and customer relationships.

### Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

1. Understand sales performance across different product categories and customer segments.
2. Identify high-performing and underperforming products to optimize inventory management.
3. Analyze customer orders and geographic trends to improve sales strategies.
4. Provide actionable recommendations to enhance business profitability and operational efficiency.

## Key Insights

For this analysis, the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is critical for structuring and understanding the relationships between the three key tables Products, Orders, and PropertyInfo in the dataset. The ERD visually represents how the data entities (tables) connect. 

The Products table provides details about items sold, including categories, names, and prices. The Orders table links products to the properties that placed the orders, tracking quantities and dates. The PropertyInfo table provides geographic information about where each property is located.

However, the relationships (e.g., ProductID linking Products and Orders, and PropertyID linking Orders and PropertyInfo) allow us to merge and analyze these datasets comprehensively.
The ERD ensures the correct implementation of SQL joins to extract meaningful insights. The ERD ensures clear connections between tables to answer key business questions and reduces the complexity of understanding raw data by organizing it into meaningful relationships, enabling the analysis of trends, customer behaviour, and inventory performance.
